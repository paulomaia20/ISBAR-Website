                    <h1>Why use iSBAR?</h1> <br>
                    <p>In the communication process between medical professionals, some gaps can occur due to the lack
                        of a formal structure for information transfer, which may lead to inadequate treatment of the
                        patients.
                        In fact, it is estimated that 70% of adverse events in healthcare, on an international level,
                        are caused by lack of communication.
                        As a solution, iSBAR (Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendations)
                        framework was proposed to be used in communication between clinicians.
                        Specifically in Portugal, Direção Geral de Saúde <a href="https://www.dgs.pt/directrizes-da-dgs/normas-e-circulares-normativas/norma-n-0012017-de-08022017-pdf.aspx">
                            released a norm </a> regulating that institutions should give specific formation to its
                        professionals of the proper way of communicating using ISBAR. </p>

                    <h1>What is SALUTEM?</h1> <br>
                    <p>Although ISBAR is taught to medical students in classes, there is no way they can further practice communication without being in a stressful clinical situation, which may not happen very often.
                         Evaluation of how well communication is being done is very subjective and purely observational. 
                         SALUTEM is a system implemented in Centro de Simulação Biomédica (CSB) from Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto (FMUP),
                          in which the phone calls performed in a simulation environment are recorded. 
                          Afterwards, the calls are transcribed using a speech-to-text algorithm, 
                          the text is further processed and there's an automatic validation 
                          of the parameters used during the call, generating a report.

                        <h1>Available options</h1> <br>
                        <p>SALUTEM has the following options:
                            <ul><li>Recording a call with the ISBAR prompt, which can be used to generate new data. This step automatically segments the call into each ISBAR parameter, as the user needs to click a button every time he wants to move on to the next communication step. </li>
                            <li>Live ISBAR Training - This mode connects the user with a call receiver, and also records the call in the dataset.</li></ul>
